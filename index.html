        <h1>The Basics of Football - Special Teams</h1>
    </header>
    <main>American Football is one of the most popular sports ever. However, some people don't understand some of the
        rules. Before looking and offense and defense, special teams is where everyone should start first. It is the first thing you use
        in a game and it is used in certain scenarios. Special teams includes punting and kicking.

        <h3>Basic Rules of Kickoff</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The ball is kicked off of a tee from the kicking team's own 40 yard line</li>
                <li>Everyone on the kicking team must stay behind that line until it is kicked</li>
                <li>The ball cannot be touched by the kicking team until it has gone ten yards</li>
                <li>The return team is spread out across the rest of the field, but the anyone on the front return line
                    must be 10 yards away</li>
            </ol>
        <article>The returners in the back may choose to let the ball go in the endzone which puts the ball at the 25
            yard line for the recieving team, called a touchback, or they can catch and attempt to return the ball for more
            yards or potentially a touchdown.</article>
        <br>
        <article>Onside kicking is when the kicking team tries to take the ball back and get another drive going. The
            ball is kicked a short distance and it is a race for who gets the ball first. This is usually attempted if there
            is a small amount of time in the game and the kicking team needs the ball to later tie or win the game.</article>

        <br>
        <aside>NOTE: The NFL (National Football League) has a different kickoff that started in 2024. The ball is
            kicked from the 35 now, and the returning is different. The rest of the kicking team is at the other 40,
            with most of the return team being 5 yards away from them. The people on the lines cannot move until it is either a
            touchback, which will go to the 30, or a return is attempted. This kicking formation originated from a spring football leaugue named the XFL. 
            Onside kicks use the old setup, but the kicking team must let the other team know that they are doing an onside kick.</aside><br>

        <h3>Punting</h3>
        <article>The punting formation is similar to a typical offensive formation, but most of the players are on the line.
            Teams will almost always have three players in front of the punter for protection. Once the ball is hiked, the punter must drop kick the ball as far as he can
        so the other team has bad field position. Kickoff returning rules apply to punting, but the returner can also get away from the ball and the punting team can pick it up, which blows the play dead.
        If the returner touches the ball and the punting team recovers it, the punt team gets the ball back on offense.</article>
        <br>
        A unique thing with punting is that the defense can block the punt, which gives a huge advantage and great field position.
            If the defense is lucky enough, they can return the blocked punt for more yards or a touchdown.
        </article><br><br>
        <div>Some extra things to note about Punting:
        <ul>
            <li>The defense can not touch the long snapper until he puts his head up after snapping the ball</li>
            <li>Some schools can use Rugby style punts, in which there are no protectors in front of the punter</li>
            <li>Punts can be faked, where the punter or another player runs or throws the ball to keep the drive going</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Field Goals/Extra points</h3>
        <div>Field goals are used when the offense cannot progress without the risk of turning the ball over. Extra points are used after touchdowns.</div><br>
        <div>Basics of field goals/extra points:
            <ul>
                <li>9 players are on the line, with the other two players, being the holder and the kicker, are behind them</li>
                <li>Once the ball is snapped, the holder will catch and hold the ball for the kicker to kick the ball</li>
                <li>If the holder can't get the ball ready for the kicker, they will have to run the ball</li>
                <li>Just like in punting, the defense can block the kick</li>
                <li>The ball is kicked through a goalpost. It is considered "good" if it goes through, and "no good" if it misses or is blocked</li>
            </ul>
