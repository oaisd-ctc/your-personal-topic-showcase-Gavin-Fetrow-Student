        <h1>The Basics of Football - Offense & Defense</h1>
    </header>
    <main>American Football is one of the most popular sports ever. However, some people don't understand some of the
        rules. Offense and Defense are core parts of the game that should be understood. Not everything will be
        explained, so this page is a rundown of the basics.</main>
    <section>
        <h2>Offense</h2>
        <article>The offense can either run of pass the ball to progress down the field to eventually get into the
            endzone for a touchdown. Before that, the offense can get first downs, which keep them going down the field.
            The offense has 4 downs to get a 1st down, but if they can't get it, they can punt it on 4th down to get the
            ball far from their own endzone. They can attempt a field goal if they are close enough to the goalposts.
        </article><br>
        <div>Some things to note about offense:
            <ul>
                <li>Linemen cannot catch the ball unless they are reported as "eligible". They also can't go downfield
                    on a pass play if they are not eligible</li>
                <li>The offense has specific plays to run where people go to different spots to block</li>
                <li>The offense cannot move when they are about to snap the ball except for anyone going in "motion"
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <aside>GAME CLOCK: The game clock starts and stops at different times. It typically stops when you go out of
            bounds forwards, a pass is incomplete, a team scores, or a team takes a timeout. In high school and college,
            the clock stops for a bit when you get a first down. In college and the NFL, there is a 2 minute warning
            towards the end of both halves.</aside>

        <h2>Defense</h2>
        <article>The job of the defense is to simply stop the offense from progressing down the field and scoring. Tere
            are a couple pieces to a defense, being the defensive line, linebackers, and the secondary. The defensive
            line wants to prevent run plays from getting through. Linebackers and the secondary can help the line with
            stopping the run play, but the secondary is more of a pass defense area.</article><br>
        <div>The defense can get something called a "turnover". When this happens, the team can then send their
            offense onto the field while the other team has to send out their defense. There are different ways to turn
            the ball over:
            <ul>
                <li>The defense catches a pass and maintains possession of it, called an interception</li>
                <li>The defense recovers a loose football or a fumble</li>
                <li>The offense fails to get a 1st down when they attempt to get it on a 4th down</li>
            </ul>
